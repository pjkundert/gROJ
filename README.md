gROJ - DSP based upon GStreamer

gROJ is an open source academic project. We propose to use the GStreamer framework for digital signal processing, analysis, generation and visualization. We are affiliated with the Gdansk University of Technology (the Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics) in Poland. The name of the project is in honor of dr. Mirosław Rojewski, who is our longtime supervisor and mentor in digital signal processing. Currently, the project is tested on the Linux platform (Debian and Ubuntu). Please check the following directories in the source code package for example scripts: test-python and test-bash. We publish first version 0.1.0 where a number of mechanisms work nice but there are also a number of bugs and issues to solve. This project will be developed still in the future. Give us some feedback if this project sounds intresting for you.

Highlights

- Possibility of loading signal from wav and txt files.
- Implementation of the time-frequency analysis: STFT and reassignment spectrogram.
- Visualization of signal's time-frequency representations.
- Visualization can be exported to the SVG picture embedded in HTML code.
- Implementation of modulation, amplification, and filtering (FIR) of signals.
- Possibility of generation few types of signal: sin, chirp, noise...
- Signal generation based upon mouse movment.
- Audio playback by using ALSA
